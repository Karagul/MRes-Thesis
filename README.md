MRes Thesis and code associated with it, some of the later model implementations are taken or adapted from the excellent https://github.com/higgsfield/RL-Adventure as well as inheriting from OpenAI gym.

Have also thrown in the numerical optimisation mini project write up as a backup (pre gathering various implementations and storing them on here).
